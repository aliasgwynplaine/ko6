## kO6 licence is MIT License


The chosen license is the most permissive I could find. In fact, the only requirement is to keep the banner at the beginning of the files. If you use kO6, let me know, I'll be happy to know and help you, if I can, to use it.

## Presentation


kO6 (*prononce it "kit-O-sys" O is  the letter not the number*) is a small operating system for educationnal purpose. Each part is added gradually, that is why it is a `k`it `O`perating `sys`tem (namely K-O-6).


## Configuration


You must source the `Source-me.sh` file to set the environment.\
You can add `source $HOME/kO6/Source-me.sh` in the `$HOME/.bashrc`.

The source files are all 100 characters long because of the many comments on the lines. Therefore, 100-character wide windows must be used for editing. The C code uses the Kernighan and Ritchie style.
